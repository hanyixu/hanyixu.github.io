I am curious about the concept of **meaningful media use**—how people engage with games or communication technologies not just for entertainment, but for connection, identity expression, learning, and even healing. One of my current research interests examines the interplay between **visual attention and in-game communication** using eye-tracking technology, grounded in media psychology theories. The aim is to understand how communication and gaze behavior shape players' engagement, team bonding, and sense of flow. Key research questions in this area include:
*   How do players allocate **visual attention** before, during, and after in-game communication events?
*   How does the **content or tone of communication** (e.g., strategic, emotional, social) influence visual attention patterns?
*   How do **synchronized visual attention and effective communication** contribute to a player’s sense of engagement, team bonding, and flow?

This research is grounded in prominent **media psychology theories**, specifically drawing on **Social Presence Theory** (explaining how media users perceive others as real and present in mediated interactions), the **Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP)** (suggesting that media users have limited cognitive resources, and attention allocation is a key determinant of message processing), and **Flow Theory** (describing a mental state of deep focus and enjoyment when skill and challenge are in balance).

In the future, I aim to contribute to both theory and practice—offering insights into **responsible game design, social media moderation, and user-centered HCI development**. Findings from studies like this are expected to provide empirical insights into how attentional processes and mediated communication shape social and cognitive experiences in digital games, informing game design and team training in virtual environments, and contributing to broader theories of mediated interaction.
