My research focuses on how interactive media, especially video games and immersive technologies such as VR and AR, influence users’ stress, motivation, and emotional well-being. I am particularly interested in understanding when interactive experiences stop being enjoyable and start becoming demanding, and how thoughtful design can make digital environments more meaningful and restorative. My master’s thesis examines when and why digital games shift from being relaxing to stressful using Bowman’s Interactivity-as-Demand framework. Broadly, I’m interested in exploring the meaningful and restorative use of immersive media and how interactive design can balance cognitive and emotional demands to enhance well-being.

I feel exhausted after playing a game → I was supposed to relax → but why after a long and engaging game I feel more tired? → my friends reported the same issue, but is it a common phenomenon in game society? → why do people keep playing under such pressure? Do they enjoy other things? → what specific element in the game triggered people's high focus in cognitive, instead of achieving relaxation goals? → Can we understand this process using the media demand model? is this meaningful?

## Background

Video games are among the most immersive and psychologically engaging forms of modern media. According to Bowman’s (2021) Interactivity-as-Demand framework, games are entertaining because they impose multiple types of “demands” on the player—cognitive, emotional, physical, and social. When these demands are balanced, players often experience a state of flow (Csíkszentmihályi, 1975), characterized by deep absorption, enjoyment, and psychological restoration.

However, when these interactive demands become excessive or imbalanced, the gaming experience may shift from being relaxing to being stressful. Players’ cognitive and emotional resources are limited; therefore, high-intensity or highly competitive games can overwhelm attention and emotional regulation systems. This overactivation leads to stress, fatigue, and even psychological strain—contradicting the original motivation to play for leisure and recovery.

Similarly, games with low social engagement—such as single-player or isolated play—can result in emotional under-stimulation and social disconnection, manifesting as loneliness. Although these games are often chosen for solitude or reflection, the absence of social demand may leave players feeling detached and unfulfilled.

So, understanding when and why games stop serving their restorative purpose is important. Theoretically, it extends existing entertainment and flow theories by examining when “interactive demand” shifts from an enjoyable challenge to a psychological burden. Empirically, it helps explain paradoxical player experiences—why some gamers report stress after competitive sessions, or why solitary gaming may increase loneliness despite being a leisure activity. Practically, it provides implications for game designers and mental health professionals to balance challenge, intensity, and social connectedness in interactive environments.

## Research Objectives

1. Identify common stress sources experienced by FPS players through online discussions.  
2. Examine how stress intensity relates to motivation and continued gameplay.  
3. Explore whether personality traits (MBTI) moderate the relationship between stress and motivation.  
4. Compare solo vs. multiplayer experiences to understand social dynamics in perceived pressure.

## Frameworks

1. **Interactivity-as-Demand Model (Bowman, 2021)**  
   This model conceptualizes video games as media that impose four distinct but interrelated demands—cognitive, emotional, physical, and social—on players. Each demand engages different psychological and physiological systems, shaping how players perceive enjoyment and appreciation. When these demands are balanced with players’ abilities and motivations, the experience is engaging and intrinsically rewarding. However, when the demands become too intense (e.g., excessive cognitive load or emotional stimulation) or too low (e.g., lack of social interaction), players may experience frustration, stress, or disengagement.

2. **Flow Theory (Csíkszentmihályi, 1975)**  
   Flow theory explains the optimal mental state when challenge and skill are well-matched. When balance is lost, players may experience either boredom or anxiety, leading to stress or disengagement instead of relaxation.

3. **Uses and Gratifications Theory (Sherry et al., 2006) and Mood Management Theory**  
   These frameworks explore how players use media to satisfy needs such as relaxation, social interaction, or mood regulation. However, games with mismatched demands may fail to meet these gratifications, leading to frustration or emotional fatigue.

## Research Questions

1. Why do high-intensity multiplayer games, such as first-person shooters (FPS), sometimes lead to psychological stress and emotional exhaustion instead of relaxation and enjoyment?  
2. Why do single-player games, often perceived as relaxing and autonomous experiences, sometimes evoke feelings of loneliness or emotional detachment?  
3. How do different types of interactive demands (cognitive, emotional, physical, and social) influence players’ affective outcomes, particularly stress and loneliness?  
4. To what extent does the mismatch between players’ expected gratifications (e.g., relaxation, social connection) and experienced demands (e.g., high intensity, isolation) predict negative emotional outcomes?

## Hypotheses

- Higher cognitive and physical demands in high-intensity multiplayer games will be positively associated with players’ perceived stress and emotional fatigue.  
- Lower social demand (e.g., in single-player or isolated gaming) will be positively associated with players’ reported loneliness and feelings of social disconnection.  
- The mismatch between expected relaxation and experienced cognitive or emotional demand will predict higher levels of psychological strain and reduced enjoyment.  
- The mismatch between expected social engagement and experienced social isolation will predict higher levels of loneliness and emotional dissatisfaction.

## Possible Outcome: Demand–Emotion Imbalance Model

- **Stimuli:** Game features, such as chat, pin, win, combat.  
- **Organismic Mediators:** Perceived demands (cognitive, emotional, physical, social).  
- **Responses:** Psychological outcomes (stress, loneliness, flow, or relaxation).

This model suggests that when perceived demands are unbalanced, players experience negative emotions such as stress or loneliness instead of relaxation or enjoyment.

## Data

- **Survey:** Collect survey data from college students aged 18–24.  
- **Reddit Posts:** Collect game-related posts from Reddit API and analyze them using NLP or AI to identify emotional and motivational patterns.
