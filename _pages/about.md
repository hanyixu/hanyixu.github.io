Syracuse Newhouse '24 <br> Columbia GSAS '25

I completed my undergraduate studies in advertising with a focus on new media strategy. Currently, I am expanding my expertise in data analysis and researching large language models. My research lies at the intersection of **media psychology, human-computer interaction, and computational social science**. I study how digital media—particularly social media platforms and online games—shape users’ emotions, identities, and social behaviors. My work uses natural language processing, semantic analysis, and survey experiments to explore topics such as gendered communication in gaming, loneliness in digital spaces, and behavioral interventions to promote civic engagement. My aim is to leverage data-driven methods to understand and improve the psychological and social impacts of emerging media technologies.

Methodologically, I integrate quantitative tools such as surveys, experiments, and machine learning (e.g., sentiment analysis and behavioral data mining), along with qualitative methods where appropriate. For this type of study, this involves using a eye-tracking system, screen recording software, and audio/video communication capture tools during gameplay sessions. Data collection includes eye-tracking metrics like fixation duration, saccades, scanpaths, and heatmaps during communication events. It also involves communication analysis by coding communication types (strategic, emotional, social) using a conversation analysis framework, and the use of survey instruments to measure perceived engagement (User Engagement Scale), team bonding (Team Identification Scale), and flow (Flow Short Scale).

I am also interested in photography. My interest in photography and videography was inspired by the cityscapes and natural beauty of my hometown, Ningbo, China. I enjoy capturing landscapes, exploring unique perspectives with drones, and creating distinctive images using film cameras.
