I completed my undergraduate studies in advertising with a focus on new media strategy. Currently, I am expanding my expertise in data analysis and researching large language models. My research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), digital communication, and media psychology. I am particularly interested in how users interact with and are affected by digital environments such as video games, social media platforms, and emerging interfaces (e.g., virtual/augmented reality).

Specifically, I am curious about the concept of meaningful media use—how people engage with games or communication technologies not just for entertainment, but for connection, identity expression, learning, and even healing. My goal is to investigate questions such as:
- How do design features in interactive media influence user immersion, empathy, or aggression?
- What communicative behaviors emerge in multiplayer games, and how do they shape social dynamics?
- How do users' offline identities and psychological traits influence their online media behaviors?

Methodologically, I integrate quantitative tools such as surveys, experiments, and machine learning (e.g., sentiment analysis and behavioral data mining), along with qualitative methods where appropriate. In the future, I aim to contribute to both theory and practice—offering insights into responsible game design, social media moderation, and user-centered HCI development.

I am also interested in photgraphy. My interest in photography and videography was inspired by the cityscapes and natural beauty of my hometown, Ningbo, China. I enjoy capturing landscapes, exploring unique perspectives with drones, and creating distinctive images using film cameras.
