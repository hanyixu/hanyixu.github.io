I recently graduated from Columbia University. I am interested in the intersection of media psychology, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and computational social science. My work uses data-driven methods to explore how digital platforms, especially online games, shape user emotions and identities.

🔬 Research Interests: I investigate the psychological impact of emerging technologies and Large Language Models (LLMs).
- 🎮 Gaming & Society: Analyzing gendered communication and toxicity in multiplayer environments.
- 🧠 Digital Well-being: Exploring loneliness and social connection in virtual spaces.
- 🗳️ Civic Engagement: Designing behavioral interventions to promote positive social outcomes.

🛠️ Methodological Toolkit: My approach integrates big data with experimental precision.
- 📊 Quantitative Analysis: Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and machine learning.
- 👁️ Biometrics: Eye-tracking (fixation, heatmaps) and screen recording to capture physiological responses.
- 📝 Surveys: Validated instruments like the User Engagement Scale (UES) to measure flow and team bonding.

📷 Through the Lens Outside the lab, I am an avid photographer. My style is rooted in the cityscapes of my hometown, Ningbo, China 🇨🇳. I enjoy capturing unique perspectives using drones and film cameras 🎞️.
