I completed my undergraduate studies in advertising with a focus on new media strategy. Currently, I am expanding my expertise in data analysis and researching large language models. I am passionate about neural network deep learning and its applications in marketing and advertising research. My goal is to further develop my coding skills, particularly in Python, and pursue research in deep learning and artificial intelligence.

My interest in photography and videography was inspired by the cityscapes and natural beauty of my hometown, Ningbo, China. I enjoy capturing landscapes, exploring unique perspectives with drones, and creating distinctive images using film cameras.
