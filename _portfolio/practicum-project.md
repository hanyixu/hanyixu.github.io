## Project Overview
The project aims to develop a prototype predictive software system for early warning of cloudbursts in urban areas. The system will analyze multiple data sources to predict the frequency and intensity of  cloudbursts within a 6-hour window, helping improve disaster preparedness for residents and businesses.

## Problem State
Every year, some regions face severe, unpredictable flooding due to the combination of intense cloudbursts and high tide events. These extreme weather patterns result in flooding within a short 4-hour window, causing widespread property damage, disrupting critical infrastructure, and leaving thousands of residents stranded. HOWEVER, current early warning systems are insufficient, often failing to provide timely alerts that allow for an effective response (Some regions that were impacted last year: UAE, Spain, Colombia, India).
