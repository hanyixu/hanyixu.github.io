I made a very interesting tool that processes calendar data using Google Gemini.

## AI Calendar Generator

[AI Calendar Generator](https://hanyixu.com/AICal/) is a web-based tool I built that automatically generates a personalized weekly schedule based on user input. Users can describe their needs in plain language (e.g., “I want to study 3 hours of Python every weekday and work out on weekends”), and the tool will return a structured calendar with suggested time blocks.


**Key Features:**
- Natural language input for flexible planning
- Automatic schedule generation
- Simple, clean interface with responsive layout
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
